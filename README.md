# ClientServerApp

Hello everyone! These are two simple applications (client and server).
The server listens to the network and sends the data received from a text file to the client when it connects.
When the client connects to the server, it accepts the data that the server sends and writes it to a file.
The application was created to familiarize me with the work of the Qt library classes (Qtcpsocket and Qtcpserver).
Bye!
